# silently dropped.
# ``search_exact_text_as_sources`` is deliberately NOT here (issue #2201): it
# returns ad-hoc matches with SYNTHETIC NEGATIVE annotation ids, which
# ``record_finding`` rejects and ``finalize`` drops. Steering the agent at it
# for "pinpoint anchors" (the #2180 prompt rule) therefore sent it hunting for
# an id it could never obtain — a 3M-token run that never finalized. The
# ``find_citable_passages`` closure (research_tasks) replaces it: same
# exact-phrase lookup, but over real Annotation rows, so every hit carries a
# ready-to-paste cite handle.

# positives (every body-paragraph citation) and miss the real headers. The

# Quotation verification (issue #2189)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Steered to quote the passages it cites, the deep-research agent was observed
# fabricating quotation-marked strings that occur nowhere in the corpus yet are
# attached to real annotation anchors — a report that *looks* rigorously cited
# but isn't. At finalize every quoted passage inside a ``<cite>`` span is checked
# against the ``raw_text`` of that span's cited annotation(s); a quote that does
# not match is demoted to plain paraphrase (its quotation marks are stripped) and
# the report is flagged. See ``research_reports._verify_cite_spans``, which runs
# this check alongside the #2200/#2201 guards in one pass over the cite spans.
#
# Only quotes of at least this many words are verified. Shorter quoted strings
# (defined terms like "Confidential Information", scare-quotes, single words) are
# left untouched: they are rarely fabricated passages and are the main source of
# false positives. The quotes fabricated in #2189 were all long passages (8+
# words).
RESEARCH_QUOTE_MIN_WORDS = 5

# A quote counts as grounded when it is a whitespace-/case-normalized substring
# of a cited annotation's text, OR its longest contiguous run that appears
# verbatim in that text covers at least this fraction of the quote. The high bar
# tolerates a trailing-punctuation / whitespace / single-character drift while
# still stripping a quote whose wording diverges (an invented tail, a reworded
# clause). Built on ``difflib.SequenceMatcher`` like the annotation-anchor fuzzy
# match in ``opencontractserver/utils/annotation_anchoring.py`` — but that path
# aggregates with ``.ratio()`` (overall similarity), whereas this uses
# longest-contiguous-block coverage (``find_longest_match().size / len(quote)``),
# a stricter test that a real run of the quote appears verbatim.
RESEARCH_QUOTE_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.92

# Upper bound on the length of a single quoted passage the verifier will inspect.
# The extraction regex is linear (a negated character class, no backtracking), so
# this is not a ReDoS guard — it bounds a pathological match when a lone opening
# quote has no nearby close, and keeps the fuzzy comparison cheap. Set generously
# so realistic block quotes are still verified; a quote longer than this is left
# untouched (a >2000-char fabricated verbatim quote is implausible).
RESEARCH_QUOTE_MAX_CHARS = 2000


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Report composition + claim-support verification (issues #2200, #2201)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ``finalize`` composes ONE document (executive summary + body) and runs the
# citation post-processors over it exactly once. Three deterministic guards run
# in that pass; the constants they key on live here.

# 1. Duplicate-summary suppression (#2200). The agent was observed passing the
#    WHOLE report as ``executive_summary`` as well as ``markdown_body``, so the
#    report rendered twice. The summary is dropped when it merely restates the
#    body: a normalized-substring hit, or a contiguous run of the summary's
#    first ``…PROBE_CHARS`` characters covering ``…THRESHOLD`` of that probe
#    inside the body. Probing the head (rather than diffing two multi-KB
#    strings) keeps this linear-ish — a genuine copy always matches from its
#    first sentence.
RESEARCH_SUMMARY_DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 0.8
RESEARCH_SUMMARY_DUPLICATE_PROBE_CHARS = 400

# 2. Echoed-cite collapse (#2200). The successor of #2183's sentence-doubling:
#    the agent writes the claim as prose and then repeats it verbatim inside the
#    `<cite>` tag, so every bullet reads twice. When a span's inner text merely
#    echoes the prose immediately before it, the span collapses to the
#    self-closing marker form (`<cite ids="…"/>`), which renders as a bare
#    footnote on the existing sentence. The threshold is the contiguous-run
#    coverage of the span text within the preceding prose.
RESEARCH_CITE_ECHO_THRESHOLD = 0.9

# How far back a self-closing `<cite ids="…"/>` marker looks for the sentence it
# decorates (also the echo-comparison window). Generous for a long legal
# sentence, bounded so the lookback stays O(1) per marker rather than O(document).
RESEARCH_SENTENCE_LOOKBACK_CHARS = 1200

# 3. Claim-support check (#2201). Generalizes the #2189 quote verifier from "is
#    this quote verbatim" to "does the cited passage say this at all". A cited
#    sentence must share at least ``…MIN_COVERAGE`` of its content words with
#    the text of the annotation(s) it cites; below that the citation is stripped
#    (the prose survives as uncited analysis) and the report is flagged.
#
#    This is a deliberately cheap, deterministic lexical floor — no LLM call, no
#    embedding round-trip at finalize. It decisively kills the two anchoring
#    failures from #2201: a one-word mention span cited for a full sentence, and
#    prompt-derived background decorated with a loosely-related entity anchor —
#    both score near zero. What it does NOT catch, so the prompt rules still
#    matter: a well-anchored sentence carrying an invented tail (#2201's
#    over-attributed paraphrase — "don't extend a cited sentence" is the guard
#    there), and a fabricated figure, since one differing number moves the ratio
#    by only 1/N (see ...MIN_TOKEN_CHARS for why numeric parity is not enforced).
#    Meaning inversion IS caught, by the polarity guard below. Swapping
#    ``_claim_is_supported`` for an entailment call is the drop-in upgrade that
#    would close the remaining two.
#
#    Only claims of at least ``…MIN_WORDS`` words are checked: short spans
#    (fragments, defined terms, a cited clause name) have too few content words
#    for a coverage ratio to mean anything and are the main false-positive
#    source. The floor is set low because stripping a CORRECT citation is worse
#    than keeping a weak one — a genuine paraphrase of its anchor clears 0.25
#    comfortably, while the failure modes above land under 0.15.
RESEARCH_CLAIM_SUPPORT_MIN_WORDS = 12
RESEARCH_CLAIM_SUPPORT_MIN_COVERAGE = 0.25

#    Polarity guard. Bag-of-words coverage is blind to negation: "the tenant is
#    NOT liable for repairs" and "the tenant is liable for repairs" differ by one
#    token and score the same against the same anchor — an inversion of the
#    source's meaning, presented with a footnote. In legal text this is the
#    highest-stakes misattribution there is (liable/not liable, permitted/
#    prohibited, terminable/non-terminable). Note that merely dropping "not"
#    from the stopword list does NOT close it: the ratio moves from ~1.0 to
#    ~0.86, still far above the floor. Parity is what catches it.
#
#    So: when a claim otherwise reads as a near-verbatim restatement of its
#    anchor (coverage at or above ...INVERSION_COVERAGE) but the two disagree on
#    whether a negation marker is present, treat it as unsupported. The high
#    coverage gate is what keeps this from firing on honest paraphrase — legal
#    text often negates lexically ("prohibited", "except", "unless") rather than
#    with a marker, but such a paraphrase shares far fewer words with the anchor
#    and never reaches the gate. Checked on the normalized text, not on
#    ``_content_words``, so the stopword list cannot hide a marker.

# Contracts negate by prefix at least as often as by particle — "non-cancelable",
# "non-transferable", "non-exclusive" — and a token-exact match misses all of
# them, leaving exactly the inversion the polarity guard exists to catch
# ("non-cancelable" against an anchor reading "cancelable"). Matched as a token
# prefix. Deliberately hyphenated and limited to "non-": bare "un"/"in" prefixes
# would fire on "under", "until", "interest" and similar, and an unhyphenated
# "non" would catch "none"/"nonetheless".
RESEARCH_SUPPORT_NEGATION_PREFIXES: tuple[str, ...] = ("non-",)

# Content-word extraction for the support check: tokens shorter than this are
# dropped along with the stopword list, so the ratio is computed over the terms
# that actually carry meaning (parties, amounts, defined terms, verbs).
# Digit-bearing tokens are EXEMPT from the floor — "10", "5%" and "$5" are two
# characters but are exactly the figures a report must not fabricate, and the
# floor was silently dropping them from both sides of the ratio so a swapped
# amount produced no signal at all. Note the exemption only restores signal; it
# does not by itself catch a fabricated figure (one differing number moves the
# ratio by 1/N). Numeric *parity*, the analogue of the polarity guard, is
# deliberately NOT applied: legal text writes the same amount as "30", "thirty
# (30)", "$5" and "$5,000,000", so parity would strip correct citations far more
# often than it caught invented ones.
