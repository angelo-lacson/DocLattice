"""Write generated artifacts into a user's personal ``My Documents`` workspace.

Every user already owns a personal corpus (``Corpus.is_personal``, provisioned
by the ``User`` ``post_save`` signal), and the document layer already knows how
to version a write (``documents.versioning.import_document``). What was missing
is a way for *generated* content — a finished research report, and later a CAML
article or an extract summary — to land there.

This service binds those primitives and nothing more. It deliberately does not
move, delete, rename or list: the workspace is an ordinary corpus, so
``CorpusService`` / ``FolderCRUDService`` / ``DocumentLifecycleService`` already
own those operations. Adding them here would duplicate a permission surface
that is already correct elsewhere.

Note that markdown documents skip the ingestion pipeline entirely (see
``documents/signals.py``): no parsing, thumbnailing or embedding. Saving is
therefore essentially free, and the saved file is a readable, versioned
artifact rather than something vector search or agent retrieval will surface.

                user's own uploads in the corpus root.
            filename_stem: Stable name for the file, minus the ``.md``
                extension. Defaults to ``title``. Pass a slug when the title
                may change between saves but the file should stay put — the
                path is the idempotency key, so a drifting name creates a new
