"""Folder CRUD and folder-tree operations for the corpus service layer.

``FolderCRUDService`` owns folder create / read / update / move / delete, the
folder tree, folder search, and bulk folder-structure creation for imports.
``delete_folder`` relocates any documents it contains to the corpus root via
:class:`~opencontractserver.corpuses.services.paths.CorpusPathService`.

Document-in-folder placement and queries live in the sibling
:class:`~opencontractserver.corpuses.services.folder_documents.FolderDocumentService`.

Split out of the former ``corpus_objs_service.py`` monolith — see
``docs/refactor_plans/2026-05-21-service-layer-phase2-corpus-services-plan.md``
(issue #1716, service-layer centralization Phase 2).

        per-folder query fan-out that the default ``CorpusFolderType``
        resolvers would otherwise produce on the folder-list view:

          * ``resolve_path`` -> ``CorpusFolder.get_path()`` -> recursive
            ancestor CTE per folder

            ``CorpusFolder.get_descendant_folders()`` (recursive descendant
            CTE) + ``COUNT`` per folder

        Replaces the ``4N`` per-folder roundtrips with:

          * 1 SQL query for the folder list (already done by
            :meth:`get_visible_folders`)
          * 1 ``GROUP BY folder_id`` query for direct document counts

          * O(N) Python passes for path resolution and descendant-count
            roll-up (no DB)

        Paths are walked via ``parent_id`` chains with memoisation so the
        ``CorpusFolder.ancestors()`` CTE never runs.  Descendant counts are
        rolled up post-order from each folder's direct count, so the
        ``CorpusFolder.descendants()`` CTE never runs either.

        Returns a list (not a queryset) because the aggregates are attached

        :meth:`get_visible_folders`.

        Permissions: identical to :meth:`get_visible_folders` (corpus READ).
        The folder-document counts intentionally count every
        ``DocumentPath`` row in the corpus (matching
        :meth:`get_folder_tree`'s contract), so a user who can READ the
        corpus but lacks per-document READ on every document still sees
        the corpus-wide structural total. Per-user document-visibility
        filtering would require an extra subquery on every call and is
        not part of the folder-listing surface; surfaces that must hide
        private documents (e.g. the document grid) filter elsewhere.

        Delete folder, atomically relocating all contained documents to root.

        **Atomicity guarantee**: The entire operation (document relocations,
        child folder reparenting, and folder deletion) runs inside a single
        ``transaction.atomic()`` block.  If ANY document cannot be relocated
        (e.g. path disambiguation exhausted, integrity constraint violation),
        the entire transaction is rolled back — no documents are moved, no
        child folders are reparented, and the folder is NOT deleted.  This
        prevents partial-success states where some documents end up at root
        while others remain stuck in the folder.

        **Retry safety**: Because a failed call leaves the database in its
        original state (full rollback), the caller can safely retry the
        operation without risk of double-moving already-relocated documents.

            user: Deleting user
            folder: Folder to delete

            persisted.
