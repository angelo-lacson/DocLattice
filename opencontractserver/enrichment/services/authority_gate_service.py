              review), so operators can filter on state alone without parsing
              ``reason``.
            - A missing source URL (``sections[0].source_url`` None/"") is
              treated as ``GATE_UNLOCATED`` when sections are present: a result
              we cannot attribute to an allowlisted domain must NOT bypass the
              domain gate on its license alone. See
